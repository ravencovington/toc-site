                    <p>With mobile and wearable devices quickly becoming the primary methods for user's engagement with technology, companies are increasingly challenged with the  decision to go mobile.  This choice isn't made lightly; decision makers have multiple factors to weigh, such as preferred platform, security, user experience and programming considerations. Yet many are unaware of the breadth of factors that should also be considered when implementing a mobile strategy, leading to poorly executed or failed attempts to deliver an app.

                        "Think Mobile" - presented by Mahlon Gumbs of <a href="http://www.nudaptix.com" target="_blank">Nudaptix</a> - helped fill in the gaps for developers, managers and other business leaders looking to deliver a mobile solution. During this session attendees learned about mobile's growth in the market place, discover the primary areas that should be evaluated before taking the leap, and review technology options in the space.
